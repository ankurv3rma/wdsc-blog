Ghost\n    is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a\n    simple personal blog.\n    \n    \n 3. For the best experience we recommend downloading the Ghost Desktop App\n    [https://ghost.org/downloads/]  for your computer, which is the best way to\n    access your Ghost site on a desktop device.\n    \n    \n\nGhost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost\nFoundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our Ghost(Pro)\n[https://ghost.org/pricing]  service, and every penny we make is re-invested\ninto funding further development of free, open source technology for modern\njournalism.\n\nThe main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: the Ghost editor\n[/the-editor/].\n\nOnce you're done reading, you can simply delete the default Ghost  user from\nyour team to remove all of these introductory posts!","feature_image":"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/welcome.jpg","featured":1,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-05-29 09:09:24","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-06-06 19:25:51","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2018-05-29 09:09:29","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial **Getting Started** posts that will help you get familiar with everything in no time.
